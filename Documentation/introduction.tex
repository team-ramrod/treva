\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{hat} is SIMD would probably be a better place to start.  This
report will detail exactly what SIMD is and why it is still useful in designing
new CPU cores.  This will be done in the context of the
\href{https://github.com/team-ramrod/treva}{TREVA} project --
\emph{Team-Ramrod's ENEL429 VHDL Assignment}.

One of the possible applications that was being explored was the implementation
of a Fast Fourier Transform \cite{Jamieson198648}.

%TODO: Introduce what's new in SIMD then what's in our report

\subsection{Spartan 3E-1600E}
% Talk about the board/FPGA we used
