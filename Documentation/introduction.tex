\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{hat} is SIMD would probably be a better place to start.  This
report will detail exactly what SIMD is and why it is still useful in designing
new CPU cores.  This will be done in the context of the
TREVA\footnote{\url{https://github.com/team-ramrod/treva}} project --
\emph{Team-Ramrod's ENEL429 VHDL Assignment}.

%TODO: Introduce what's new in SIMD then what's in our report

To test the SIMD core  and compare it to a SISD core, test applications are
needed. One of the possible applications that was being explored was the
implementation of a Fast Fourier Transform \cite{Jamieson198648}. The other
application, which is not as useful for real applications, but still would
produce valuable metrics is ghosting two images. This provides one image
overlaid on top of another with 50\% opacity. This also produces a visual output
that can be inspected for errors.


\subsection{Spartan 3E-1600E}
% Talk about the board/FPGA we used
To run the VHDL code and provide results, a Spartan 3E-1600 Development Board
was provided. This development board hosts a Xilinx XC3S1600E FPGA with 1600K
logic gates. The board also holds a array of various external peripherals,
including UART, 10-100 Ethernet, Flash memory, DDR memory, LCD display, PS/2
mouse or keyboard port, buttons, LEDs and switches.
