\section{Conclusion}
An existing FPGA soft-core processor was extended to support SIMD instructions
by the addition of multiple ALUs in parallel to the existing one. The implications that 
this had on memory access, opcodes and operands, the control unit and top level 
design were investigated. 

An assembler and a debugger were implemented in a high level language to enable 
development of the testing routines.
