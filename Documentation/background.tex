\section{Background}
\subsection{SIMD}
\subsection{Leros}
In order to avoid carrying out redundant work, the decision was made to utilise
an existing solution. The advantages were twofold; it allowed for much faster
development and had already been tested by many people. Opencores \footnote{
http://www.opencores.com } is a well-known collection of hardware solutions for
FPGAs and ASICs, in both VHDL and Verilog. Our requirements called for a VHDL
microcontroller, which there were many to choose from. Other critera were
simplicity, small code size, and a RISC architecture. One project stood out
after applying these critera - the Leros microcontroller.  Leros is a 16-bit
processor optimized for FPGAs \cite{cite:TODO}, and was selected for use in this
project.
