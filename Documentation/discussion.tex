\subsection{Effects of Single-Cycle Instructions}
The Leros code base was designed for single clock cycle instructions. Such a
restriction poses few problems for addition and subtraction instructions, but
there was the possibility that any further added operations may not be able to be
completed in a single cycle. This presents a problem because Leros' pipelined
design relies on these single cycle instructions.

It was originally thought that the goals of the project would benefit from
multiply and divide instructions. There was no way to control whether these
would be implemented as single-cycle, as this would be decided during the
synthesis stage by the Xilinx compiler. Fortunately, after implementation of the
multiplication operation, inspection of the RTL schematic showed that this
instruction had indeed been implemented single-cycle.

Division was not expected to be implemented as a single-cycle instruction by
Xilinx, and this suspicion was confirmed on inspection of the RTL schematic
after a division instruction was added. For this reason, no division instruction
was included in the final design, in order to ensure that the pipeline
architecture was not compromised. The lack of a division instruction did not
hinder the project, however it is worth noting this deficiency.
