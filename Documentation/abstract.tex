\begin{abstract}
This report explores the implementation and testing of a Single Instruction
Multiple Data (SIMD) Accumulator based CPU on a Xilinx FPGA development board.
An open source VHDL CPU was modified to allow SIMD instructions to be processed.
Example applications in basic image processing were planned, but not fully implemented.
