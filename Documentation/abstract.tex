This report explores the implementation and testing of a Single Instruction
Multiple Data (SIMD) Accumulator based CPU on a Xilinx FPGA development board.
An existing microcontroller project \emph{Leros} is used as a base for development,
and is extended to include new instructions and multiple accumulators. A complete
redesign of the ALU is carried out to accommodate the needs of the project. The design
is synthesised and implemented on the Xilinx board and tested with programs written 
and assembled with a custom assembler written specifically for the project. A simulator is
also written to test the design. The expected results were not observed due to an
unresolved issue with the IO inside the FPGA, however it is expected that this would
be resolved given more time.
